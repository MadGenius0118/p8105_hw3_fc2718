## Problem 3

                                                              'More than high school')))

acc_df =

combined_df = inner_join(demographics_df, acc_df, by="seqn")

  as_tibble()

### Comments: `education_df` demonstrates that in this dataset, number of female subjects received more than high school education (n=59) is higher than male subjects (n = 54), and number of female subjects received less than high school education (n=28) is greater than male subjects (n = 27) as well. Based on the distribution plot, we perceived both in female and male groups, the age in education level less than high school is mostly between the age 20 to 40. The age for female subject received high school equivalent lies between 60 and 80.

``` r
total_activity_df = 
  combined_df |> 
  mutate(sum_activity= rowSums(combined_df[6:ncol(combined_df)]))


ggplot(total_activity_df, aes(x=age, y=sum_activity,color=education)) +
  geom_point(size=4) +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +
  facet_grid(~sex) +
  labs(title = "Distribution of total activity for men and women in each education category") +
  theme(text = element_text(size = 30)) 
```

\### Comments: for both females and males, we perceived a decreased
trend as the age increases. Additionally, among the three education
categories, the peak oftotal activity was perceived in age less the 30
for females and age above 60 in males.

``` r
plot_df =
  combined_df |> 
  pivot_longer(min1:min1440, 
               names_to ="time",
               names_prefix = "min", 
               values_to="activity") |> 
  group_by(time, sex, education) |> 
  summarise(sum_activity = sum(activity)) |> 
  mutate(time = as.numeric(time))
  
```

``` r
ggplot(plot_df, aes(x=time, y=sum_activity, color=sex)) +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +
  facet_grid(~education) +
  labs(title = "Activity Over Day for Each Education Level") +
  theme(text = element_text(size = 30)) 
```

### Commments: In general, the activity trends were increasing from the begining to mid time during the day, and started to decline afterwards. As depicted from the graph, in less than high school education level, we perceived that males have higher activity level than females at the eariler time (1 min to 500 min), whereas females have higher activity level at later times. In high school equivalent level, males tended to have higher activity over the day compared to females, whereas in the education group of more than high school, females have greater activity across the day.
